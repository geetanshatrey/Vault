HeyðŸ‘‹

Ever come across passwords like â€˜passwordâ€™, â€˜123456â€™ or â€˜abcdefgâ€™?

Precisely why we need something called Two-Factor Authentication.

Imagine youâ€™re a bad person who steals peopleâ€™s money ðŸ˜ˆ

And you see this.
"""

let descriptionForThirdScreen = """
Just passwords arenâ€™t good enough ðŸš«

With ever increasing frauds happening all around we need something stronger and more secure to protect our valuables.
"""

let descriptionForFourthScreen = """
Enter Two-Factor Authentication aka 2FA ðŸ”’

With 2FA, after username and password, you need one more piece of information to enter the application. It can be a question, a key, an OTP, your biometric, etc.
